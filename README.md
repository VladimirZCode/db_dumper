## Database dumper

"db_dumper" dumps a database based on commands provided through a ENV configuration and uploads the dump to a cloud.
Features of the dumper:
 - All configuration options are provided via ENV configuration. Create a .env file from .env.dist file to provide specific configuration options.
 - The dump is uploaded to Google Drive if the option is provided in the command parameters.
 - It is built as a command line application.

## Installation

Pull or download the following necessary folders and files:

```
dbdump, src, .env.dist, google-service-account-keys.json, application.php, composer.json, composer.lock
```

### Configuration

 - Create your .env file from .env.dist.
 - Fill "DB_DUMP_FOLDER_ID". Copy it from the Google Drive.
 - Example of "DB_DUMP_COMMANDS_LIST" to create and download the database dump via SSH:

 ```
 'ssh user@192.168.16.2 mysqldump -hdb -udb -pdb --databases db --skip-comments | gzip -c > %s; scp user@192.168.16.2:%s .'
 ```

 - Create your google-service-account-keys.json file from google-service-account-keys.json.dist with the credentials.
 - Create a project on https://console.cloud.google.com/. Register there as a developer, get an authorization key for the google-service-account-keys.json file.

Install the dependencies:

```
composer install
```
